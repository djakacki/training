               Women's Networks:
               Julia Morgan and Her Clients
               Sara Holmes Boutelle</p><p facs="#facs_1_r_2_1">
               Clients are the catalysts of architec-
               ture; they enable the architect's
               thoughts on paper to exist in three
               dimensions, and they may often
               play a creative role in the design process.
               Yet the crucial relationship between de-
               signer and client and the manner in which
               an architect receives a commission have
               largely been kept in the wings of architec-
               tural history. In the case of women archi¬
               tects and designers this relationship is of
               particular complexity. For women, entrée
               into traditional centers of power and in¬
               fluence, in an economic and political sense
               —the milieus that afford the contacts
               which develop clients—is largely closed.
               An examination of the clients of Julia
               Morgan, the most prolific independent
               woman architect in American architectur¬
               al history, provides an understanding of
               how a woman functioned as a profession¬
               al within the restrictions inherent in being
               a woman before World War II. Approxi-
               mately half of Morgan's clients were
               women or institutions for women. She
               determinedly avoided publicity and self-
               promotion. Most of her important clients
               developed not as a result of accounts of
               her work in popular and professional jour¬
               nals but from social connections and rec¬
               ommendations from former clients and a
               network of both women of wealth and
               women professionals of more modest
               economic means.
               In 1902, after completing a first degree
               at Berkeley in engineering, Julia Morgan
               completed a course in the section of archi¬
               tecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in
               Paris. She was the first woman in the
               school's history to be accepted for this
               course. For 40 years she headed her own
               architectural firm in San Francisco, and
               when she died at age 85 in 1957 she had
               designed some 700 buildings. She de¬
               signed within an eclectic vocabulary,
               drawing on both the academic Beaux-Arts
               and traditional California vernacular ar¬
               chitecture for inspiration. She practiced in
               this mode with close attention to the de¬
               sires of her clients and to sound construc¬
               tion. Many of her commissions were the
               result of earlier ones for the same clients.
               From the beginning of her career, Julia
               Morgan was encouraged by women. Mor¬
               gan's very first client, while she was still
               in Paris at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, was
               Mrs. Harriet Fearing, an expatriate from</p><p facs="#facs_1_r_4_1">
               Julia Morgan.</p><p facs="#facs_1_r_5_1">
               New York and Newport. Fearing asked
               Morgan to add a grand salon to her 17th-
               century house in Fontainebleau, where she
               could present musicales and exhibitions
               by her young protegées in the arts. The
               room was built in 1902 and was used as it
               had been intended until at least the middle
               of World War I, when Mrs. Fearing had to
               return temporarily to Newport. The speci¬
               fications, including bills from masons,
               chimney-builders, locksmiths, and orna¬
               mental plasterers—all addressed to "Mlle.
               Morgan, Architecte"—were saved with
               her Beaux-Arts drawings and are in the
               Documents Collection at Berkeley.
               Shortly after her return to California
               Morgan managed to set up her own office
               in San Francisco. Her first major building
               project was the Mills College Campanil of
               1903-1904, the first college bell tower in
               the West. Susan Mills, the president (and
               co-founder) of this college for women,
               found a benefactor for the project in Frank
               Smith, the husband of one of her trustees.
               Undoubtedly Mrs. Mills liked the idea of
               an Oakland woman being the architect in
               charge of the project, but Mr. Smith
               listened to the complaints of the contract¬
               or, Bernard Ransome, who did not believe
               any young lady could understand rein-</p><p facs="#facs_1_r_6_1">
               forced concrete. Yet the tower withstood
               the earthquake of 1906. After quite a con¬
               troversy, which almost makes it seem
               that Smith rather than Mills was the
               client, the completed tower was dedi¬
               cated, with Ransome's name ahead of
               Morgan's in the program. (The plaque on
               the tower said: "Erected by Mr. and Mrs.
               Frank Smith.“) The Mills commission
               brought others. Susan Mills commissioned
               Morgan to do the library, the gymnasium,
               the social hall, and the infirmary at the
               college, while Mr. Smith hired her to
               build a large "cottage" as a refuge for
               young women in whom his wife took a
               charitable interest.
               Among Morgan's significant clients,
               Phoebe Apperson Hearst was one of the
               earliest. The connection with Mrs. Hearst
               was vital to Morgan's career. It was
               through Mrs. Hearst that Morgan became
               the "house" architect for western YWCAs.
               Phoebe Hearst's example led to the com¬
               misson for San Simeon, the William
               Randolph Hearst estate, which in turn led
               to an association with Marion Davies, the
               presiding hostess at San Simeon, who
               later commissioned important works from
               Morgan.</p><p facs="#facs_1_r_7_1">

               Morgan's involvement with Mrs.
               Hearst began in her student days at the
               Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Mrs. Hearst pro¬
               vided stipends for all California students
               at the Ecole. In Paris Morgan had an
               apartment in the same house as Bernard
               Maybeck, who designed Hearst Hall for
               the University of California. This was first
               used as a reception pavilion for Mrs.
               Hearst's Berkeley house and later moved
               to the university. Morgan worked on
               some of the drawings for Hearst Hall. In
               1910 Mrs. Hearst, or "the Empress" as she
               was called in certain circles in San Fran¬
               cisco, commissioned Morgan to enlarge
               and embellish her home The Hacienda“
               in Pleasanton. The house became a social
               center for entertaining not just the family
               and personal friends, but beneficiaries of
               the various good works promoted by
               Mrs. Hearst. This included especially the
               women students of Berkeley and workers
               in the YWCA movement all over the
               West. The Hearst connection is obviously
               the key to understanding how Julia Mor-
               gan obtained her most important institu¬
               tional client, the YWCA.
               The Pacific Coast Field Committee of
               the National Y had conferred annually
               since 1900 at the old Hotel Capitola near
               the beach at Santa Cruz. When the hotel
               was destroyed by fire in 1912, Phoebe
               Hearst invited the conference to "The
               Hacienda," where she had a tent city</p><p facs="#facs_2_r_2_1">
               erected on the grounds, with facilities for
               300 (including 300 pairs of rubbers and
               300 umbrellas when a rainstorm came
               up). The camp equipment became the
               basic furniture for the conference grounds,
               established the next year in Pacific Grove.
               Here a tract of 30 acres along the ocean
               was given to the YWCA by the Pacific Im¬
               provement Company, with the stipula¬
               tion that improvements worth 530,000 be
               made within 10 years. This became Asilo¬
               mar (refuge by the sea). Mrs. Hearst pro¬
               vided funds for the first Assembly Hall,
               now the Hearst Administration Building.
               The architect to plan and supervise the
               whole enterprise (built throughout the
               20s) was Julia Morgan.
               Between 1913 and 1915, she was also
               engaged in constructing large urban
               YWCAs in Oakland and San Jose, only
               the first of many Ys Morgan would de¬
               sign. Commissions for those two struc¬
               tures may have come at least in part from
               the influence of Morgan's sorority sister
               Grace Fisher, who was a YWCA board
               member. Julia Morgan wrote to Phoebe
               Hearst in 1919, saying how much she ap¬
               preciated what had grown out of the
               General Plan“ of Asilomar—the relation¬
               ship with the New York National YWCA
               Board, and in fact the offer to work there
               permanently to oversee building plans
               nationally (which she did not undertake).
               Morgan continues: "And so through it all</p><p facs="#facs_2_r_3_1">
               is the thread of your kindness since those
               Paris days when you were so beautifully
               kind to a most painfully shy and home¬
               sick girl.
               The YWCA work naturally brought
               other institutional and private commis¬
               sions from those associated with the Y.
               Hettie Belle Marcus, who was a board
               member of the YWCA when Morgan was
               building the high-rise YWCA residence in
               San Francisco in 1932, retained her to
               build a penthouse atop her own residence
               on Lombard Street in 1935. Elsa Schilling,
               also a member of the residence board, had
               Morgan build a Lake Tahoe house for her
               in 1939, which remains even today, a
               showplace. Miss Schilling was one of the
               founders of a scholarship in the architec¬
               ture school in Morgan's name when she
               died.
               Morgan's work at Mills College also
               brought her new and important commis¬
               sions. Dr. Mariana Bertola had been the
               college physician at Mills when Morgan
               was engaged in building there. Immedi¬
               ately after the earthquake, when Dr.
               Bertola's house and office were destroyed
               by fire, she commissioned a new set of
               two buildings, one for offices and one for
               her residence on Jackson Street in San
               Francisco. These still stand, converted to
               apartments. Dr. Bertola's role as a client
               became more significant as she herself
               took on expanding leadership in the city.</p><p facs="#facs_2_r_4_1">

               Susan Mills, Julia Morgan's first client.
               As President of the Federation of Woman's
               Clubs when they were engaged in their
               Save-the-Redwoods" campaign, she saw
               to it that Morgan built the memorial to
               the efforts of the clubs at Humboldt Park.
               Then, as the chief mover in the Native
               Daughters of the Golden West, she ar¬
               ranged for Morgan to be the architect for
               the new state headquarters and residence
               on Baker Street in San Francisco.
               The late 19th and early 20th century
               witnessed the growth of important wom¬
               en's institutions such as clubs and colleges.
               Morgan was often chosen as the designer
               for California women's clubs. Morgan de¬
               signed a number of women's clubs, al¬
               though the state federation does not seem
               to have served as a client, since each local
               group was well under way and usually in
               a clubhouse before affiliation with the
               federation took place. At any rate, the
               Foothill Club in Saratoga, organized in
               1907 chose a building committee which
               asked Morgan for plans in 1914. The local
               newspaper reported that the architect sub¬
               mitted four possible designs, and in 1915
               brought in the completed building unani¬
               mously chosen by their committee, for the
               sum of 54500. This clubhouse was insured
               for 5150,000 in the ’70s. The chairman of
               the building committee of the Minerva
               Club in Santa Maria had lived in Berkeley,
               where she had admired Morgan's resi¬
               dences and churches; Morgan was chosen
               as the architect for the new building. In
               Sausalito in 1918 the Women's Club met
               with some skepticism from fathers and
               brothers who heard of their choice of a
               woman architect. One concerned husband
               eft a trust fund for repairs for this club
               which he believed would inevitably fall
               apart. They were never able to touch that
               fund, so solid was the building, until a
               friendly lawyer made a case for refurbish¬
               ing it for the nation's Bicentennial to qual¬
               ify for the repair fund!</p><p facs="#facs_3_r_3_1">
               Morgan's own membership in the
               Century Club of San Francisco afforded
               her still another client. The club owned a
               building, but with growing membership,
               their headquarters seemed inadequate.
               They called on their own member, Julia
               Morgan, to enlarge and remodel it, and
               her work stands as a source of pride to the
               group. The Monday Club in San Luis
               Obispo and the Friday Morning Club in
               Los Angeles testify to many a busy week
               for this architect.
               As for Berkeley, here would naturally
               assemble a sizable force of vigorous, edu¬
               cated women who wanted a club building
               which would rival anything in the city or
               in the state. This they secured in the
               Berkeley Women's City Club (now co¬
               educational), a castlelike six-story struc¬
               ture designed around two courts, with a
               large daylighted swimming pool and flex-
               ible arrangements of dining rooms, draw¬
               ing rooms, ballroom-auditorium, several
               kitchens, even a flower-arranging room.
               Magnificent ceilings, fireplaces, the grand
               staircase, all bespeak an elegance and
               sophistication for urban users. Every
               detail, including the lighting fixtures, the
               dishes, the linen, was of Morgan's design,
               and she also chose the furnishings.
               Institutions for the education of wom¬
               en increased rapidly during the first part
               of the 20th century. The original Theta“
               building (1908), the "Zeta" sorority (1910),
               and the Women's Social Hall, Girton
               (1911), all at the University of California,
               were commissions that surely came be¬
               cause Morgan was an alumna. Private
               secondary schools she designed include
               the Barnard School in Berkeley, Ransom
               and Bridges in Piedmont, the Burke and
               Hamlin Schools in San Francisco. All
               were founded by women, to provide an
               education of the highest quality for girls.
               Many of her domestic commissions
               also came from women. Mrs. Elsie Drex¬
               ler, who was listed as "Capitalist“ in the
               San Francisco Directory, commissioned a
               redwood residence with pergolas, in
               Woodside; it is still one of the great
               houses of the Peninsula area. Mrs. Liver¬
               more of Livermore had Morgan build her
               a small house in the country and another
               on Russian Hill in San Francisco, behind
               the Willis Polk house at the crest. In 1916,
               when materials were scarce, the architect
               used windows salvaged from the Panama¬
               Pacific Exposition, and the house for Mrs.
               Livermore, on three levels with a foot¬
               bridge to the path uphill, is almost aus¬
               tere, although the extravagant views of
               city and bay make a strong appeal to the
               senses. Mrs. Starr, whose family had two
               Morgan houses in Piedmont, commis¬
               sioned one in the hills above Fremont.
               Mrs. Brayton of Oakland had Morgan
               design a house suitable for entertaining on
               a large scale (her son recalls lavish masked
               balls with butlers pouring champagne for</p><p facs="#facs_3_r_5_1">

               the dancers while the children watched
               from a balcony). She then commissioned
               another house in Piedmont with a theatre
               upstairs, and a cottage“ at Pebble Beach,
               designed around a Della Robbia plaque
               brought back from a European trip. Clara
               Huntington Perkins assisted Morgan with
               the designs for the tiles for her hilltop
               aerie in Los Gatos. Mrs. David Gamble
               was the head of the building committee
               for the Pasadena YWCA. Mrs. Cecil B.
               deMille was head of the building commit-
               tee for the Hollywood Studio Club, a tem¬
               porary residence and club for young
               women aspiring to become part of the
               movie industry.
               At the same time Julia Morgan was
               designing simple, compact houses of red¬
               wood for teachers and doctors who did
               not have a lot of money. Drs. Elsa Mitch¬
               ell and Clara Williams had a small red¬
               wood house built on a steep hillside fall¬
               ing away to the bay in Berkeley. The office
               and garage were in front at the upper
               level, while the living space was oriented
               to the rear where the view of the bay is
               still awe-inspiring. Dr. Ruth Huffman of
               Petaluma had an earlier house remodeled
               to serve as both residence and lying-in
               hospital. Dr. Emma Wightman Pope, a
               college friend of Morgan s, had her build
               a retirement cottage on the hill overlook¬
               ing the Mission at Carmel. Jessica Peixot¬
               to, a classmate at the University of Cal¬
               ifornia in 1894 and the first woman to
               gain a Ph.D. from Berkeley as well as the
               first woman professor there, commis¬
               sioned a modest house near the campus.
               Miss Mollie Conners, an Oakland jour¬
               nalist, also turned to Morgan for a simple
               house in Piedmont, as did Annie Caroline
               Edmonds, a high school teacher of mathe¬
               matics (one of five women in Berke¬
               ley's class of 1882). She wanted a larger
               income-producing house in Berkeley. The
               latter redwood structure, finished in 1904,</p><p facs="#facs_3_r_7_1">

               shows a sophisticated handling of space
               and details of craftsmanship which would
               continue to characterize the work of this
               architect.
               No account of Morgan clients would
               be complete without mention of some of
               the families who called on her more than
               once for domestic and commercial build¬
               ings. Mrs. Glide of Sacramento commis¬
               sioned her friend to build the Public Mar-
               ket, presently offices for the Secretary of
               State, and a fine house on the outskirts of
               her city. Then, as each Glide daughter
               married and settled in Berkeley, each had
               a Morgan house in a different style, one
               Tudor, one Georgian, and the third a
               handsome California original which now
               belongs to the university. Julia Morgan
               also built huge hay barns at Clarksburg,
               near Sacramento, for the Glide family
               Mrs. Glide once asked Morgan to design a
               Methodist Church for a Glide memorial in
               San Francisco, but when she saw the</p><p facs="#facs_4_r_2_1">

               plans, she said it would be too expensive
               (a notoriously frugal lady, Mrs. Glide)
               and suggested that the entrance should be
               changed to economize. Morgan said that
               if she wanted it that way she should find
               another architect. She did.
               Social connections and past clients as
               the key to commissions is not a phenom¬
               enon particular to women. What is un¬
               usual is that it is unlikely that any male
               would have a roster of clients that was 50
               percent institutions for women or women
               commissioning domestic buildings. This is
               as revealing about women architects and
               Morgan as it is about women themselves.
               These women's institutions and the wom¬
               en clients had a consciousness about their
               womanhood and about the support of
               other women that led them to patronize a
               woman when a qualified woman was
               available. It was in large part because of
               this that Morgan was able to execute so
               many buildings.</p><p facs="#facs_4_r_5_1">
               Julia Morgan is not well known even
               among those interested in architecture.
               There are many reasons for this. She
               shunned publicity, her work was designed
               in an eclectic mode which 20th-century
               historians are just beginning to appreci¬
               ate, and lastly it is possible that, as much
               of her work was done for women, it may
               have been ignored as out of the main¬
               stream.</p><p facs="#facs_4_r_6_1">
