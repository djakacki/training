            <head>MRS DALLOWAY IN BOND STREET</head>
            <byline>BY <persName>VIRGINIA WOOLF</persName></byline>

            <p><persName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" key="Clarissa Dalloway" xml:space="default" type="fictional">Mrs Dalloway</persName> said she would buy the gloves herself.</p>
            <p><objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" xml:space="default" type="building">Big Ben</objectName> was striking as she stepped out into the street. It was <time>eleven o'clock</time> and
               the unused hour was fresh as if issued to children on a beach. But there was
               something solemn in the deliberate swing of the repeated strokes; something stirring
               in the murmur of wheels and the shuffle of footsteps.</p>
            <p>No doubt they were not all bound on errands of happiness. There is much more to be
               said about us than that we walk <placeName>the streets of Westminster</placeName>. <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" xml:space="default" type="building">Big Ben</objectName> too is nothing
               but steel rods consumed by rust were it not for the care of <orgName type="civic">H. M.'s Office of Works</orgName>.
               Only for <persName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" key="Clarissa Dalloway" xml:space="default" type="fictional">Mrs Dalloway</persName> the moment was complete; for <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Mrs Dalloway</persName> <date>June</date> was fresh. A
               happy childhood—and it was not to his daughters only that <persName>Justin Parry</persName> had seemed a
               fine fellow (weak of course on <orgName type="judicial">the Bench</orgName>); flowers at evening, smoke rising; the caw
               of rooks falling from ever so high, down down through the October air—there is
               nothing to take the place of childhood. A leaf of mint brings it back; or a cup with
               a blue ring.</p>
            <p>Poor little wretches, she sighed, and pressed forward. Oh, right under the horses'
               noses, you little demon! and there she was left on the kerb stretching her hand out,
               while <persName key="James Dawes" type="fictional">Jimmy Dawes</persName> grinned on the further side.</p>
            <p>A charming woman, poised, eager, strangely white-haired for her pink cheeks, so <persName key="Scope Purvis">Scope Purvis, C. B.</persName>, saw her as he hurried to his office. She stiffened a little, waiting
               for <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">Durtnall's van</objectName> to pass. <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="building" xml:space="default">Big Ben</objectName> struck the tenth; struck the eleventh stroke. The
               leaden circles dissolved in the air. Pride held her erect, inheriting, handing on,
               acquainted with discipline and with suffering. How people suffered, how they
               suffered, she thought, thinking of Mrs Foxcroft at <placeName type="governmental">the Embassy</placeName> last night decked with
               jewels, eating her heart out, because that nice boy was dead, and now the old Manor
               House (<objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">Durtnall's van</objectName> passed) must go to a cousin.</p>
            <p>"Good morning to you!" said <persName key="Hugh Whitbread" type="fictional">Hugh Whitbread</persName> raising his hat rather extravagantly by
               the china shop, for they had known each other as children. "Where are you off
               to?"</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LEAF-VRE/leaf_workshops/main/exercises/MrsDalloway_in_BondStreet/dalloway_images/dalloway_02.jpg"/>
            <p>"I love walking in <placeName type="city">London</placeName>" said <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Mrs Dalloway</persName>. "Really it's better than walking in the
               country!"</p>
            <p>"We've just come up" said <persName key="Hugh Whitbread" type="fictional">Hugh Whitbread</persName>. "Unfortunately to see doctors."</p>
            <p>"<persName key="Milly Whitbread">Milly</persName>?" said <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Mrs Dalloway</persName>, instantly compassionate.</p>
            <p>"Out of sorts," said <persName key="Hugh Whitbread">Hugh Whitbread</persName>. "That sort of thing. <persName key="Richard Dalloway" type="fictional">Dick</persName> all right?"</p>
            <p>"First rate!" said <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Clarissa</persName>.</p>
            <p>Of course, she thought, walking on, <persName key="Milly Whitbread" type="fictional">Milly</persName> is about my age—fifty—fifty-two. So it is
               probably that, <persName key="Hugh Whitbread">Hugh's</persName> manner had said so, said it perfectly—dear old <persName key="Hugh Whitbread" type="fictional">Hugh</persName>,
               thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Mrs Dalloway</persName>, remembering with amusement, with gratitude, with emotion, how
               shy, like a brother—one would rather die than speak to one's brother—<persName key="Hugh Whitbread" type="fictional">Hugh</persName> had always
               been, when he was at <orgName type="university">Oxford</orgName>, and came over, and perhaps one of them (drat the thing!)
               couldn't ride. How then could women sit in <orgName type="government">Parliament</orgName>? How could they do things with
               men? For there is this extraordinarily deep instinct, something inside one; you can't
               get over it; it's no use trying; and men like <persName key="Hugh Whitbread">Hugh</persName> respect it without our saying it,
               which is what one loves, thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Clarissa</persName>, in dear old <persName key="Hugh Whitbread">Hugh</persName>.</p>
            <p>She had passed through the <placeName type="monument">Admiralty Arch</placeName> and saw at the end of the empty road with
               its thin trees Victoria's white mound, Victoria's billowing motherliness, amplitude
               and homeliness, always ridiculous, yet how sublime, thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Mrs Dalloway</persName>, remembering
               <placeName type="palace">Kensington Gardens</placeName> and the old lady in horn spectacles and being told by Nanny to
               stop dead still and bow to the <persName key="Queen Victoria" type="real">Queen</persName>. The flag flew above <placeName key="Buckingham Palace" type="palace">the Palace</placeName>. The <persName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" key="King George V" xml:space="default">King</persName> and
               <persName key="Queen Mary">Queen</persName> were back then. <persName key="Richard Dalloway" type="fictional">Dick</persName> had met her at lunch the other day—a thoroughly nice
               woman. It matters so much to the poor, thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Clarissa</persName>, and to the soldiers. A <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="statue" xml:space="default">man in bronze stood heroically on a pedestal with a gun</objectName> on her left hand side—<eventName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="war" xml:space="default">the South African war</eventName>. It matters, thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Mrs Dalloway</persName> walking towards <placeName key="Buckingham Palace" type="palace">Buckingham Palace</placeName>.
               There it stood four-square, in the broad sunshine, uncompromising, plain. But it was
               character she thought; something inborn in the race; what <orgName type="people">Indians</orgName> respected. <persName key="Queen Mary" type="both">The Queen</persName> went to hospitals, opened bazaars—<persName key="Queen Mary">the Queen of England</persName>, thought <persName>Clarissa</persName>,
               looking at <placeName key="Buckingham Palace" type="palace">the Palace</placeName>. Already at this hour a <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">motor car</objectName> passed out at <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="structure" xml:space="default">the gates</objectName>;
               <orgName type="military">soldiers</orgName> saluted; <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="structure" xml:space="default">the gates</objectName> were shut. And <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Clarissa</persName>, crossing the road, entered <placeName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" key="St James Park" xml:space="default" type="park">the Park</placeName>, holding herself upright.</p>
            <p><date>June</date> had drawn out every leaf on the trees. The <orgName type="people">mothers of <pb n="22" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LEAF-VRE/leaf_workshops/main/exercises/MrsDalloway_in_BondStreet/dalloway_images/dalloway_03.jpg"/> Westminster</orgName> with mottled
               breasts gave suck to their young. Quite respectable girls lay stretched on the grass.
               An elderly man, stooping very stiffly, picked up a crumpled paper, spread it out flat
               and flung it away. How horrible! Last night at <placeName type="government">the Embassy</placeName> <persName key="Sir Dighton">Sir Dighton</persName> had said "If I
               want a fellow to hold my horse, I have only to put up my hand." But the religious
               question is far more serious than the economic, <persName key="Sir Dighton" type="fictional">Sir Dighton</persName> had said, which she
               thought extraordinarily interesting, from a man like <persName key="Sir Dighton">Sir Dighton</persName>. "Oh, the country
               will never know what it has lost" he had said, talking, of his own accord, about dear
               <persName key="Jack Stewart" type="fictional">Jack Stewart</persName>.</p>
            <p>She mounted the little hill lightly. The air stirred with energy. Messages were
               passing from <orgName type="military">the Fleet</orgName> to <orgName type="military">the Admiralty</orgName>. <placeName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="street" xml:space="default">Piccadilly</placeName> and <placeName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="street" xml:space="default">Arlington Street</placeName> and <placeName type="street">the Mall</placeName>
               seemed to chafe the very air in <placeName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" key="St James Park" xml:space="default" type="park">the Park</placeName> and lift its leaves hotly, brilliantly, upon
               waves of that divine vitality which <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Clarissa</persName> loved. To ride; to dance; she had adored
               all that. Or going long walks in the country, talking, about books, what to do with
               one's life, for young people were amazingly priggish—oh, the things one had said! But
               one had conviction. Middle age is the devil. People like <persName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" key="Jack Stewart" xml:space="default" type="fictional">Jack</persName>'ll never know that, she
               thought; for he never once thought of death, never, they said, knew he was dying. And
               now can never mourn—how did it go?—a head grown grey. . . . From the contagion of the
               world's slow stain . . . have drunk their cup a round or two before. . . . From the
               contagion of the world's slow stain! She held herself upright.</p>
            <p>But how <persName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" key="Jack Stewart" xml:space="default" type="fictional">Jack</persName> would have shouted! Quoting <persName key="Percy Bysshe Shelley" type="real">Shelley</persName>, in Piccadilly! "You want a pin," he
               would have said. He hated frumps. "My God <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Clarissa</persName>! My God <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Clarissa</persName>!"—she could hear
               him now at <eventName>the <placeName key="Devonshire House" type="residence">Devonshire House</placeName> party</eventName>, about poor <persName key="Sylvia Hunt" type="fictional">Sylvia Hunt</persName> in her amber necklace
               and that dowdy old silk. <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Clarissa</persName> held herself upright for she had spoken aloud and
               now she was in <placeName key="Picadilly" type="street">Piccadilly</placeName>, passing the house with the slender green columns, and the
               balconies; passing club windows full of newspapers; passing old <placeName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" key="Lady Burdett Coutts house" xml:space="default" type="residence"><persName key="Lady Burdett Coutts" type="fictional">Lady Burdett Coutts</persName>' house</placeName> where the glazed white parrot used to hang; and <placeName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" key="Devonshire House" xml:space="default" type="residence">Devonshire House</placeName>, without its
               gilt leopards; and <placeName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" key="Claridge's Hotel" xml:space="default" type="hotel">Claridge's</placeName>, where she must remember <persName key="Richard Dalloway">Dick</persName> wanted her to leave a
               card on <persName key="Mrs Jepson" type="fictional">Mrs Jepson</persName> or she would be gone. Rich Americans can be very charming. There
               was <placeName key="St James Palace" type="palace">St James palace</placeName>; like a child's game with bricks; and now—she had passed <placeName key="Bond Street" type="street">Bond Street</placeName>—she was by <placeName key="Hatchard's book shop" type="business">Hatchard's book shop</placeName>. The <pb n="23" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LEAF-VRE/leaf_workshops/main/exercises/MrsDalloway_in_BondStreet/dalloway_images/dalloway_04.jpg"/>
               stream was endless—endless—endless.
               Lords, Ascot, Hurlingham—what was it? What a duck, she thought, looking at the
               frontispiece of some book of memoirs spread wide in the bow window, <persName key="Joshua Reynolds" type="real">Sir Joshua</persName>
               perhaps or <persName key="George Romney">Romney</persName>; arch, bright, demure; the sort of girl—like her own <persName key="Elizabeth Dalloway" type="fictional">Elizabeth</persName>—the
               only <emph cert="high" rend="italic" xml:space="default">real</emph> sort of girl. And there was that absurd book, <title key="Mr. Sponge's Sporting Tours" level="m">Soapy Sponge</title>, which <persName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" key="Jim" xml:space="default" type="fictional">Jim</persName> used to quote by the yard; and <title key="Shakespeare's Sonnets" level="m">Shakespeare's Sonnets</title>. She knew them
               by heart. <persName key="Phil" type="fictional">Phil</persName> and she had argued all day about the Dark Lady, and <persName key="Richard Dalloway">Dick</persName> had said
               straight out at dinner that night that he had never heard of her. Really, she had
               married him for that! He had never read <persName key="William Shakespeare" type="real">Shakespeare</persName>! There must be some little cheap
               book she could buy for <persName key="Milly Whitbread" type="fictional">Milly</persName>—<title key="Cranford" level="m">Cranford</title> of course! Was there ever anything so
               enchanting as the cow in petticoats? If only people had that sort of humour, that
               sort of self-respect now, thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Clarissa</persName>, for she remembered the broad pages; the
               sentences ending; the characters—how one talked about them as if they were real. For
               all the great things one must go to the past, she thought. From the contagion of the
               world's slow stain. . . . Fear no more the heat o' the sun. . . . And now can never
               mourn, can never mourn, she repeated, her eyes straying over the window; for it ran
               in her head; the test of great poetry; the moderns had never written anything one
               wanted to read about death, she thought; and turned.</p>
            <p><objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">Omnibuses</objectName> joined <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">motor cars</objectName>; <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">motor cars</objectName> <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">vans</objectName>; <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">vans</objectName> <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">taxicabs</objectName>; <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">taxicabs</objectName> <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">motor cars</objectName>—here
               was an <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">open motor car</objectName> with a <persName>girl</persName>, alone. Up till four, her feet tingling, I know,
               thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Clarissa</persName>, for the girl looked washed out, half asleep, in the corner of the
               car after the dance. And another <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">car</objectName> came; and <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">another</objectName>. No! No! No! <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Clarissa</persName> smiled
               good-naturedly. The fat lady had taken every sort of trouble, but diamonds! orchids!
               at this hour of the morning! No! No! No! The excellent <persName type="fictional">policeman</persName> would, when the time
               came, hold up his hand. Another <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">motor car</objectName> passed. How utterly unattractive! Why
               should a <persName>girl</persName> of that age paint black round her eyes? And a young man, with a girl,
               at this hour, when the country—The admirable <persName type="fictional">policeman</persName> raised his hand and <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Clarissa</persName>
               acknowledging his sway, taking her time, crossed, walked towards <placeName key="Bond Street" type="street">Bond Street</placeName>; saw the
               narrow crooked street, the yellow banners; the thick notched telegraph wires
               stretched across the sky.</p>
            <p>A hundred years ago her great-great-grandfather, <persName key="Seymour Parry">Seymour Parry</persName>, who ran away with
               Conway's daughter, had walked down <placeName key="Bond Street" type="street">Bond <pb n="24" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LEAF-VRE/leaf_workshops/main/exercises/MrsDalloway_in_BondStreet/dalloway_images/dalloway_05.jpg"/> Street</placeName>.

               walked for a hundred years, and might have met <orgName type="family">the Dalloways</orgName> (<orgName type="family">Leighs</orgName> on the mother's
               side) going up. Her father got his clothes from <orgName type="business">Hill's</orgName>. There was a <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="goods" xml:space="default">roll of cloth</objectName> in
               the <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="structure" xml:space="default">window</objectName>, and here just one <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="glassware" xml:space="default">jar</objectName> on a <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="furniture" xml:space="default">black table</objectName>, incredibly expensive; like the
               thick pink salmon on the <objectName>ice block</objectName> at the <orgName type="store">fishmonger's</orgName>. The jewels were
               exquisite—pink and orange stars, paste, Spanish, she thought, and chains of old gold;
               starry buckles, little brooches which had been worn on sea green satin by ladies with
               high head-dresses. But no good looking! One must economize. She must go on past the
               picture dealer's where one of the odd French pictures hung, as if people had thrown
               confetti—pink and blue—for a joke. If you had lived with pictures (and it's the same
               with books and music) thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Clarissa</persName>, passing the <placeName key="Aeolian Hall" type="venue">Aeolian Hall</placeName>, you can't be taken
               in by a joke.</p>
            <p>The river of <placeName key="Bond Street" type="street">Bond Street</placeName> was clogged. There, like a Queen at a tournament, raised,
               regal, was <persName key="Lady Bexborough">Lady Bexborough</persName>. She sat in her carriage, upright, alone, looking through
               her glasses. The <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="clothing" xml:space="default">white glove</objectName> was loose at her wrist. She was in black, quite shabby,
               yet, thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Clarissa</persName>, how extraordinarily it tells, breeding, self-respect, never
               saying a word too much or letting people gossip; an astonishing friend; no one can
               pick a hole in her after all these years, and now, there she is, thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Clarissa</persName>,
               passing the <persName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" key="Lady Bexborough" xml:space="default" type="fictional">Countess</persName> who waited powdered, perfectly still, and <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Clarissa</persName> would have
               given anything to be like that, the mistress of <placeName type="residence">Clarefield</placeName>, talking politics, like a
               man. But she never goes anywhere, thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Clarissa</persName>, and it's quite useless to ask
               her, and the <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="vehicle" xml:space="default">carriage</objectName> went on and <persName key="Lady Bexborough">Lady Bexborough</persName> was borne past like a Queen at a
               tournament, though she had nothing to live for and <persName key="Lord Bexborough" type="fictional">the old man</persName> is failing and they
               <persName key="Lady Bexborough">say</persName> she is sick of it all, thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Clarissa</persName> and the tears actually rose to her eyes
               as she entered <orgName type="store">the shop</orgName>.</p>
            <p>"Good morning" said <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Clarissa</persName> in her charming voice. "Gloves" she said with her
               exquisite friendliness and putting her <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="accessory" xml:space="default">bag</objectName> on the counter began, very slowly, to undo
               the <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="accessory" xml:space="default">buttons</objectName>. "White gloves" she said. "Above the elbow" and she looked straight into
               the <persName type="fictional">shopwoman</persName>'s face—but this was not the girl she remembered? She looked quite old.
               "These really don't fit" said Clarissa. The <persName>shop girl</persName> looked at them. "Madame wears
               bracelets?" <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Clarissa</persName> spread out her fingers. "Perhaps it's my rings." And <persName>the girl</persName>
               took the <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="clothing" xml:space="default">grey gloves</objectName> with her to the end of the <objectName cert="high" evidence="internal" full="yes" instant="unknown" type="furniture" xml:space="default">counter</objectName>.</p>
            <p>Yes, thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Clarissa</persName>, if it's the girl I remember she's twenty <pb n="25" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LEAF-VRE/leaf_workshops/main/exercises/MrsDalloway_in_BondStreet/dalloway_images/dalloway_06.jpg"/>
               years older. . . .
               There was only one other customer, sitting sideways at the counter, her elbow poised,
               her bare hand drooping, vacant; like a figure on a Japanese fan, thought <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway">Clarissa</persName>,
               too vacant perhaps, yet some men would adore her. The lady shook her head sadly.
               Again the gloves were too large. She turned round the glass. "Above the wrist" she
               reproached the grey-headed woman; who looked and agreed.</p>
            <p>They waited; a clock ticked; <placeName key="Bond Street" type="street">Bond Street</placeName> hummed, dulled, distant; the woman went away
               holding gloves. "Above the wrist" said the lady, mournfully, raising her voice. And
               she would have to order chairs, ices, flowers, and cloak-room tickets, thought
               <persName key="Clarissa Dalloway" type="fictional">Clarissa</persName>. The people she didn't want would come; the others wouldn't. She would stand
               by the door. They sold stockings—silk stockings. A lady is known by her gloves and
               her shoes, old <persName key="Uncle William (Parry?)">Uncle William</persName> used to say. And through the hanging silk stockings
               quivering silver she looked at the lady, sloping shouldered, her hand drooping, her
               bag slipping, her eyes vacantly on the floor. It would be intolerable if dowdy women
               came to her party! Would one have liked Keats if he had worn red socks? Oh, at
               last—she drew into the counter and it flashed into her mind:</p>
            <p>"Do you remember before the war you had gloves with pearl buttons?"</p>
            <p>"French gloves, Madame?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, they were French" said Clarissa. The other lady rose very sadly and took her
               bag, and looked at the gloves on the counter. But they were all too large—always too
               large at the wrist.</p>
            <p>"With pearl buttons" said the shop-girl, who looked ever so much older. She split the
               lengths of tissue paper apart on the counter. With pearl buttons, thought Clarissa,
               perfectly simple—how French!</p>
            <p>"Madame's hands are so slender" said the shop girl, drawing the glove firmly,
               smoothly, down over her rings. And Clarissa looked at her arm in the looking glass.
               The glove hardly came to the elbow. Were there others half an inch longer? Still it
               seemed tiresome to bother her—perhaps the one day in the month, thought Clarissa,
               when it's an agony to stand. "Oh, don't bother" she said. But the gloves were
               brought.</p>
            <p>"Don't you get fearfully tired" she said in her charming voice, "standing? When d'you
               get your holiday?"</p>
            <p>"In September, Madame, when we're not so busy."</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LEAF-VRE/leaf_workshops/main/exercises/MrsDalloway_in_BondStreet/dalloway_images/dalloway_07.jpg"/>
            <p>When we're in the country thought Clarissa. Or shooting. She has a fortnight at
               Brighton. In some stuffy lodging. The landlady takes the sugar. Nothing would be
               easier than to send her to Mrs Lumley's right in the country (and it was on the tip
               of her tongue). But then she remembered how on their honeymoon Dick had shown her the
               folly of giving impulsively. It was much more important, he said, to get trade with
               China. Of course he was right. And she could feel the girl wouldn't like to be given
               things. There she was in her place. So was Dick. Selling gloves was her job. She had
               her own sorrows quite separate, "and now can never mourn, can never mourn" the words
               ran in her head, "From the contagion of the world's slow stain" thought Clarissa
               holding her arm stiff, for there are moments when it seems utterly futile (the glove
               was drawn off leaving her arm flecked with powder)—simply one doesn't believe,
               thought Clarissa, any more in God.</p>
            <p>The traffic suddenly roared; the silk stockings brightened. A customer came in.</p>
            <p>"White gloves," she said, with some ring in her voice that Clarissa remembered.</p>
            <p>It used, thought Clarissa, to be so simple. Down down through the air came the caw of
               the rooks. When Sylvia died, hundreds of years ago, the yew hedges looked so lovely
               with the diamond webs in the mist before early church. But if Dick were to die
               to-morrow as for believing in God—no, she would let the children choose, but for
               herself, like Lady Bexborough, who opened the bazaar, they say, with the telegram in
               her hand—Roden, her favourite, killed—she would go on. But why, if one doesn't
               believe? For the sake of others, she thought, taking the glove in her hand. This girl
               would be much more unhappy if she didn't believe.</p>
            <p>"Thirty shillings" said the shopwoman. "No, pardon me Madame, thirty-five. The French
               gloves are more."</p>
            <p>For one doesn't live for oneself, thought Clarissa.</p>
            <p>And then the other customer took a glove, tugged it, and it split.</p>
            <p>"There!" she exclaimed.</p>
            <p>"A fault of the skin," said the grey-headed woman hurriedly. "Sometimes a drop of
               acid in tanning. Try this pair, Madame."</p>
            <p>"But it's an awful swindle to ask two pound ten!"</p>
            <p>Clarissa looked at the lady; the lady looked at Clarissa.</p>
            <p>"Gloves have never been quite so reliable since the war" said the shop-girl,
               apologizing, to Clarissa.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LEAF-VRE/leaf_workshops/main/exercises/MrsDalloway_in_BondStreet/dalloway_images/dalloway_08.jpg"/>
            <p>But where had she seen the other lady?—elderly, with a frill under her chin; wearing
               a black ribbon for gold eyeglasses; sensual, clever, like a Sargent drawing. How one
               can tell from a voice when people are in the habit, thought Clarissa, of making other
               people—"It's a shade too tight" she said—obey. The shopwoman went off again. Clarissa
               was left waiting. Fear no more she repeated, playing her finger on the counter. Fear
               no more the heat o' the sun. Fear no more she repeated. There were little brown spots
               on her arm. And the girl crawled like a snail. Thou thy wordly task hast done.
               Thousands of young men had died that things might go on. At last! Half an inch above
               the elbow; pearl buttons; five and a quarter. My dear slow coach, thought Clarissa,
               do you think I can sit here the whole morning? Now you'll take twenty-five minutes to
               bring me my change!</p>
            <p>There was a violent explosion in the street outside. The shopwomen cowered behind the
               counters. But Clarissa, sitting very up-right, smiled at the other lady. "Miss
               Anstruther!" she exclaimed.</p>
