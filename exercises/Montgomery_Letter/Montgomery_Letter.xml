            <salute> Dear Sir,</salute></opener>

         <p> I received your letter of the 19th – November 22nd. I will go to Hamilton on Friday on
            C.P.R. train that leaves Toronto at 
            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LEAF-VRE/training/main/getting_started/exercises/Montgomery_Letter/Montgomery-Cloke_0002.jpg"/> 
            10 o’clock and gets to Hamilton at 2:13. I
            hope someone from your store can meet me at train as I am a stranger in Hamilton. I
            shall want to leave for Toronto on 4:29 train. Professor Edgar said in his letter to me
            that you wanted me to speak or 
            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LEAF-VRE/training/main/getting_started/exercises/Montgomery_Letter/Montgomery-Cloke_0003.jpg"/> 
            read. That was why I referred to it. I am much
            better pleased to find that I am not expected to do this as it will be much less
            strenuous. </p>
         <closer>Yours sincerely, L.M.M. MacDonald</closer>
